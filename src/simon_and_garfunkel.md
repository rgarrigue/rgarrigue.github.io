# Simon & Garfunkel 

## The Sound Of Silence

Hello darkness, my old friend 
I've come to talk with you again 
Because a vision softly creeping 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping 
And the vision that was planted in my brain 
Still remains 
Within the sound of silence 

In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobblestone 
'Neath the halo of a street lamp 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light 
That split the night 
And touched the sound of silence 

And in the naked light I saw 
Ten thousand people, maybe more 
People talking without speaking 
People hearing without listening 
People writing songs that voices never share 
And no one dared 
Disturb the sound of silence 

"Fools," said I, "You do not know 
Silence, like a cancer, grows 
Hear my words that I might teach you 
Take my arms that I might reach you" 
But my words, like silent raindrops fell 
And echoed in the wells, of silence 

And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made 
And the sign flashed out its warning 
In the words that it was forming 
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls 
And tenement halls" 
And whispered in the sounds of silence

## Scarborough Fair

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme  
Remember me to one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt  
(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme  
(Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground)  
Without no seams nor needlework 
(Blankets and bedclothes, the child of the mountains)  
Then she'll be a true love of mine  
(Sleeps unaware of a clarion call)  

Tell her to find me an acre of land  
(On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves) 
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme  
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)  
Between the salt water and the sea strand  
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)  
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather  
(War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions)  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme  
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)  
And gather it all in a bunch of heather 
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten) 
Then she'll be a true love of mine

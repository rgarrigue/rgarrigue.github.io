## The Bard's Song  

Now you all know  
The bards and their songs  
When hours have gone by  
I'll close my eyes  
In a world far away  
We may meet again  
But now hear my song  
About the dawn of the night  
Let's sing the bard's song  

Tomorrow will take us away  
Far from home  
No one will ever know our names  
But the bards' songs will remain  

Tomorrow will take it away  
The fear of today  
It will be gone  
Due to our magic songs  

There's only one song  
Left in my mind 
Tales of a brave man 
Who lived far from here  
Now the bard's songs are over 
And it's time to leave 
No one should ask you for the name of the one  
Who tells the story 

Tomorrow will take us away 
Far from home 
No one will ever know our names 
But the bard's songs will remain 

Tomorrow all will be known 
And you're not alone 
So don't be afraid in the dark and cold 
'Cause the bard's songs will remain 
They all will remain 

In my thoughts and in my dreams 
They're always in my mind 
These songs of hobbits, dwarves and men 
And elves 
Come close your eyes 
You can see them too
